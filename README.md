# Analyzing-Traffic-Mortality-in-the-US
Investigating how to derive a strategy to reduce the incidence of road accidents across the nation. By looking at the demographics of traï¬ƒc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?  To accomplish these tasks, we will make use of data wrangling, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering.
